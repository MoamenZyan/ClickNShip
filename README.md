## Summery
It was an unforgettable experience, orchestrating everything to harmonize seamlessly! Moreover, it marked our debut with two technologies: C# .NET and React. It's my inaugural venture into utilizing .NET as a backend, and diving into Next.js as a frontend web framework.

Admittedly, the website may appear clunky and occasionally suffer from bugs and sluggishness, but this is merely the beginning. Along the journey, I'll grasp the best practices and refine our approach to achieve a more professional outcome.
